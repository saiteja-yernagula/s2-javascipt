javascript
javascript is highlevel programming
language that is used to create
interactive and dynamic nature 
to the website

terms
single threaded- it will executre one line at a time
interpreted-compiled-- highlevel code to low level code
           JIT -just in time compilation
cross platform - use in any os and browser
dynamically typed- no need to define datatype


javascript was introduced by brendan eich in 1995
within 10days
es-1- 1997
es-2 1998
es-3 1999
es-4
es-5 2009
es-6-2015- changes and pre requistic 
es-15

to run js
html-css --browser
javascript --engine - browser
firefox - spider monkey
chrome- v8 
edge- chakra


without browser - node js

how js engine works
parser - it will continously check syntax
ast(abstract syntax tre) generator - splitting the code into tokens
compilation - high to low 
execution -output



line 1
line 2 - 2mins
line 3


line1
line3
line2


event loop mechanism or javascript run time environment

callstack - it will executed the functions 
webapi - it will provide feature like timers, api calls
        storage , location inside the browser
callback que- it is the place where code will wait
event loop - it will continously monitor callstack

synchronous -line and line 3
which doesnt takes time which executes immediately

 and 
 asynchronous -line 2 
 which executes parallely and which takes time





write a javascript alert in internal , external, inline 

Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different
 types of variables (var, let, and const) and
  prints their values to the console.

Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, 
undefined, null, object, array, and function

Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable
 to the console
   




 
Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using 
different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.


Expand the script to include a ternary operation 
that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and 
set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades:
  A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45).
   Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30),
  "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19), and "Cold" (below 10). 
  Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child"
  (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), 
  and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result
